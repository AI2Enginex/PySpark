# Linear Regression

# Key steps in my project included:

1] Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.

2] Feature engineering: creating new features and selecting relevant ones for model training.

3] Model training and evaluation: using PySpark's MLlib to build a Linear Regression model and evaluating its performance using metrics like RMSE and R-squared.
